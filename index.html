  <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
  <p>Born and raised in Salem, Oregon, but I did spend a good portion of my childhood living in Portland. After graduating high school I went to community college for two years but dropped out one term before receiving my AA because I wasn't sure of what I really wanted to do. Having always wanted to be a musician, I pursued becoming an audio engineer and eventually opened my own recording studio in Salem. I recorded local artists full time for about three years until my daughter was born. After taking a year off work to be with my daughter full time, I decided to leave the studio behind and find a new direction. I've always had interest in computer science and web development, but I never knew where to start. One of my best friends recently graduated from Epicodus and landed an amazing job not too long after. I immediately knew that this would be the next step in a new direction for me. <br> I spend most of my free time hanging out with my family, being outside, and if I have time, writing and recording my own music.</p>
