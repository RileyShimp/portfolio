      <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
      <p>Born and raised in Salem, Oregon, but I did spend a good portion of my childhood living in Portland. After graduating high school I went to community college for two years but dropped out one term before receiving my AA because I wasn't happy with the direction my life was going.<img src="img/IMG_4690.jpg" alt="Riley" width="30%"> Having always wanted to be a musician, I pursued becoming an audio engineer and eventually opened my own recording studio in Salem. I recorded local artists full time for about three years until my daughter was born. After taking a year off work to be with my daughter full time, I decided to leave the studio behind and find a <em>new direction</em>. I've always had interest in computer science and web development, but I never knew where to start. One of my best friends recently graduated from Epicodus and landed an amazing job not too long after. I immediately knew that this would be the next step in a <em>new direction</em> for me. <br> I spend most of my free time hanging out with my family, being outside, and if I have time, writing and recording my own music.

        <h2>Three things that make me excited about Web Development</h2>
        <li>I love learning new skills, and in web development there is no limit to the amount that I can learn. I will start now, and continue learning for the rest of my career.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>The sky is the limit. Who knows what kind of amazing projects I'll be able to be a part of in the future. I might even create some cool projects of my own. Applications, websites, front-end, back-end... The possibilities are endless.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Working side by side with others in a dev team, and helping each other to solve more problems faster. I look forward to working in a field where my peers know they can rely on me when help is needed. </li>
